# speedrun-backend
A simple Single Page Application which allows users to create and modify playlists of their favorite video game speedruns. All playlists and saved videos are connected to an external server/database deployed on Heroku.

## Synopsis

This project was my Q2 project at the Galvanize Web Development Immersive. The purpose of this project was to create a full-stack application in a week. The initial motivation for this project was to create a tool to improve discoverability of videos of world-record video game speedruns. Everyone who is into the speedrun community has a favorite game or two that they love watching the speedrun of and allowing users to share them with others in the community could potentially be a fun and useful tool.

## Technology Used

The backend of this project currently uses Node.js, Axios, Express.js, Knex, PostgreSQL and Heroku.
